# Architecture 
### Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Express, which is a Node.js framework, serves as the backend for routing and handling requests. Express dynamically renders and sends static or server-side rendered HTML pages to the browser using templating engines such as Handlebars. This application uses an SPA which loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates its content as the user interacts with the application, which eliminates the need for full page reloads. JavaScript is the main language used in this application, Node.js on the backend and TypeScipt on the front. 
### Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
MongoDB stores data in flexible JSON-like documents. This allows for dynamic schemas, meaning the structure of data can evolve more fluidly without the need for rigid schema migrations, perfect for evolving data formats. MongoDB is also designed for horizontal scalability, enabling distribution of data across multiple servers to handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads. All of these benefits, along with its robust ecosystem and compatability with various tools and frameworks, make this database a perfect fit for the application. 
# Functionality
### How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It's a text based format for representing structured data, mostly used for transmitting data between a server and a web application. JSON's syntax is derived from JavaScript object literal syntax and acts as a universal language for data exchange. The server typically processes requests from the frontend and retrieves or manipulates data from a database, which is then formatted into a JSON string and sent as a response to the frontend. The frontend receives the JSON string, parses it into a JavaScript object, and then uses said data to dynamically update the user interface. Essentially, JSON ensures that both the frontend and the backend, regardless of the specific programming language or frameworks used, can userstand and process the exchanged data efficiently. 
# Testing
### Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
Methods define the type of action a client wishes to perform on a resource at a specific endpoint. The methods used in this application, also the most common, are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. GET retrieves data from the server. POST submits data to the server, or creates a new resource. PUT replaces an existing resource entierly. PATCH partially updates an exsisting resource. DELETE removes a resource from the server. An endpoint is a specific URL that represents a unique resource or a set of resources within an API. Testing these endpoints using Postman with authentication, in this case token-based authentication, to verify the identity of a user attempting to access resources as well as determining what authenticated users are permitted to do. Security is a crutial part in any full stack application, ensuring the protection of data and resources throughout the entire system.
# Reflection
### How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
This course has helped me tremendously in reaching my professional goals. Learning the detailed steps in creating a web application from scratch, utitilzing the MEAN stack, is a well sought after skill. I have learned how to build and deploy a scalable application using JavaScript and Express HTML, utilizing a MongoDB, and test said application through the Postman API. The ability to develop a client-side user interface or clean server-side scalable code is a skill in itself, but the capability to understand and implement full stack development will allow me to become a more marketable candidate in my career field.
