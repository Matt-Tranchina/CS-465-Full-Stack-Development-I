# Architecture 
## Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Express, which is a Node.js framework, serves as the backend for routing and handling requests. Express dynamically renders and sends static or server-side rendered HTML pages to the browser using templating engines such as Handlebars. This application uses an SPA which loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates its content as the user interacts with the application, which eliminates the need for full page reloads. JavaScript is the main language used in this application, Node.js on the backend and TypeScipt on the front.
